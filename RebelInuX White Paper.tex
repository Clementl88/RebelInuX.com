% Introduction sentence
\textbf{RebelInuX's future tokenomics focus on sustainability and community growth through transparent token burns, buy-backs, and vesting strategies, aimed at enhancing token stability and long-term value.}

\subsection[
  \texorpdfstring{\color{primaryColor}Future Burning Mechanism}{Future Burning Mechanism}
]{\color{primaryColor}Future Burning Mechanism}
We are committed to implementing a transparent and systematic token burning process. This mechanism will involve periodically reducing the circulating supply by burning a percentage of tokens from designated wallets. Details such as the \underline{frequency} and \underline{percentage} of tokens to be burned will be communicated clearly through updates on our website and in the white paper.

Stay tuned as we work toward making our ecosystem more \underline{deflationary} and community-driven.

\subsection[
  \texorpdfstring{\color{primaryColor}Vesting and Lock-up Periods}{Vesting and Lock-up Periods}
]{\color{primaryColor}Vesting and Lock-up Periods}
Tokens allocated to the team and advisors will be subject to vesting schedules over a specified period to promote long-term commitment. Additional lock-up periods may also apply to certain allocations to ensure ecosystem stability.

\subsection[
  \texorpdfstring{\color{primaryColor}Token Utility}{Token Utility}
]{\color{primaryColor}Token Utility}
RebelInuX tokens will serve various functions within our ecosystem, including governance voting, staking for rewards, participation in liquidity pools, and potentially, transaction fee discounts.
\subsection[
  \texorpdfstring{\color{primaryColor}Incentives and Rewards}{Incentives and Rewards}
]{\color{primaryColor}Incentives and Rewards}
Participants will earn rewards through staking, liquidity mining, and community activities, aligning incentives to foster ecosystem growth.
\subsection[
  \texorpdfstring{\color{primaryColor}Future Buy-Back Protocol}{Future Buy-Back Protocol}
]{\color{primaryColor}Future Buy-Back Protocol}
In addition to token burns, we plan to implement a \underline{buy-back} mechanism where a portion of the project's revenue or treasury funds will be used to purchase tokens from the open market. This buy-back aims to:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Reduce circulating supply and support token price stability.
  \item Demonstrate ongoing commitment to token value appreciation.
  \item Potentially be complemented by periodic burns of the bought-back tokens.
\end{itemize}

Details such as the \underline{percentage} of revenue allocated for buy-backs, \underline{frequency} of buy-back events, and \underline{mechanics} of execution will be transparently communicated as the protocol is developed.

\smallskip
\textbf{\large RebelInuX (REBL)} was initially launched via oriontools.io as a community-oriented meme token, emphasizing fun, engagement, and collective participation. Currently, the token primarily functions as a meme coin, without on-chain governance mechanisms in place.

\subsection[
  \texorpdfstring{\color{primaryColor}Future Governance Framework}{Future Governance Framework}
]{\color{primaryColor}Future Governance Framework}

Recognizing the importance of community involvement in shaping the project's future, the RebelInuX team aims to implement a comprehensive governance system. This will enable token holders to actively participate in key decision-making processes, including proposing initiatives, voting on proposals, and influencing strategic directions—fostering transparency, decentralization, and shared ownership.

\subsection[
  \texorpdfstring{\color{primaryColor}Proposed Governance Protocols}{Proposed Governance Protocols}
]{\color{primaryColor}Proposed Governance Protocols}

The governance system will leverage Solana-compatible protocols such as the Solana Program Library (SPL) Governance or Realms. These platforms will facilitate token staking, proposal submission, and voting, ensuring the community’s voice is central to the project's evolution.

\subsection[
  \texorpdfstring{\color{primaryColor}Community-Driven Development}{Community-Driven Development}
]{\color{primaryColor}Community-Driven Development}

This transition aims to strengthen community trust, promote active engagement, and align project growth with supporter interests. The team is committed to developing an inclusive, secure, and scalable governance model that supports sustainable, community-led decision-making and long-term success.

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=headerColor!10!white, colframe=headerColor, boxrule=2pt, width=\textwidth, arc=6mm, left=8mm, right=8mm, top=6mm, bottom=6mm]

At RebelInuX, our core principles of transparency, decentralization, and security form the foundation of our project. We believe that true empowerment arises from eliminating centralized points of control and fostering a community-driven environment.

To uphold these principles, the project has \textbf{renounced the Freeze Authority, Mint Authority, and Update Authority}. This means:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{No central authority can freeze or mint new tokens} without community consensus, ensuring fair distribution and safeguarding against malicious actions.
    \item \textbf{All updates and governance decisions are driven by the community}, establishing a trustless and democratic environment.
    \item \textbf{The project operates on Solana’s secure and scalable platform}, leveraging its robust security features to protect our community and assets.
    \item \textbf{Regular audits and transparent reporting} will be conducted to ensure the security and integrity of token allocations and smart contracts.
\end{itemize}

By fully decentralizing our operations, we aim to build an unstoppable rebellion—one resilient to censorship, manipulation, and centralized control. Our commitment to transparency and security is designed to foster trust and ensure that RebelInuX remains a truly community-led movement.
