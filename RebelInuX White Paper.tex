    {\Large \bfseries Introduction} \\[0.5em]
    \textbf{RebelInuX} pioneers a novel meme coin model with a \textbf{triple-asset ecosystem} on ZORA. This creates a direct link between \textbf{digital ownership} of a Creator Coin, \textbf{community identity} with a Content Coin NFT, and \textbf{\$REBL token rewards}, merging collectible art with a secure claim mechanism.\\

    Inspired by the \textbf{fearless Shiba Inu} spirit, we embody \textbf{rebellion}, \textbf{humor}, and \textbf{decentralization}. Our ultimate goal is to achieve complete decentralization, transferring all control to the community and eliminating any central points of failure. By acquiring the core duo of assets, holders become \textbf{core participants} in our community and gain the ability to claim \textbf{\$REBL tokens} across chains. Join us as we disrupt and redefine the meme coin landscape.

]{\color{primaryColor}Overview and Utility}
The RebelInuX ecosystem is powered by a novel triple-asset model on \textbf{ZORA}, designed to merge community engagement with secure, verifiable value distribution. As illustrated in the \hyperref[sec:Architecture]{\textbf{Architecture Overview}}, this system operates across chains and consists of three interconnected assets that work together to distribute the \textbf{RebelInuX (\$REBL)} meme coin on Solana: % <-- REFERENCE ADDED HERE

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{The Creator Coin: Your Digital Claim Ticket.} This is the core value-bearing asset. Each Creator Coin grants you a fixed allocation of \$REBL tokens from the Solana community pool, distributed during designated claim periods. Its ownership is the primary data point verified by the \textbf{Claim Process} shown in the architecture.
    \item \textbf{The Content Coin NFT: Your Identity \& Secure Bridge.} This NFT serves as your unique identity within the Rebel Pack and is the secure communication channel for the cross-chain claiming process (see \textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:contentcoin}}). It does not hold the claimable value itself but is essential for initiating the transfer, as it contains the Solana wallet address required for distribution.
    \item \textbf{The \$REBL Token: Your Cross-Chain Reward.} This is the final reward token distributed on Solana to holders of both core assets during claim periods. Its value is directly accelerated by the ecosystem's activity through the \textbf{Value Acceleration Mechanism}.
\end{itemize}

This innovative separation ensures securityâyour claim power (Creator Coin) and your cross-chain destination (provided via the Content Coin) are never held in a single, vulnerable location. By acquiring both core assets, you secure your membership in an exclusive pack with a direct, verifiable stake in the growth of \$REBL.

]{\color{primaryColor}How to Claim \$REBL Tokens}

The process to claim your \$REBL tokens is a secure, multi-step operation tied to specific claim periods:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Acquire the Core Duo of Assets:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Purchase a Creator Coin:} This is your claim ticket. On our ZORA collection page, click the \textbf{"Trade"} button to acquire it. Ownership grants you a fixed allocation of \$REBL tokens.
        \item \textbf{Purchase a Content Coin NFT:} This is your secure communication key. To acquire it, navigate to any individual NFT in the collection and click the \textbf{"Buy"} button.
    \end{itemize}
    Both assets are available in our collection on the ZORA marketplace: \href{https://zora.co/@rebelinux}{https://zora.co/@rebelinux}.

    \item \textbf{Wait for a Claim Period:} Token distributions occur during designated, pre-announced claim periods (e.g., quarterly). The timing will be clearly communicated on our official channels. You only need to hold both core assets at the time of the snapshot for each claim period.
    \item \textbf{Initiate the Cross-Chain Claim:} When a claim period is active:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Navigate to the ZORA page for your specific \textbf{Content Coin NFT}.
        \item \textbf{Leave a public comment containing your Solana public address.}
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{tcolorbox}[colback=red!5!white, colframe=red!75!black, title=\textbf{SECURITY WARNING}, fonttitle=\bfseries]
    \textbf{ONLY share your public address (e.g., \texttt{ahWDSP4...3MUiI}).} \\\textbf{NEVER} share your private key, seed phrase, or sign a malicious transaction.
    \end{tcolorbox}

    \item \textbf{Receive Your \$REBL Tokens on Solana:} Our system will scan for verified claims made during the active period. Upon confirmation, the \textbf{full amount} of your allocated \$REBL tokens for that period will be sent directly to your provided Solana wallet address.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Guaranteed \$REBL Allocation:} Ownership of the \textbf{Creator Coin} grants you a right to a fixed allocation of \$REBL tokens, distributed over the claim periods. The \textbf{Content Coin NFT} is your key to securely claiming them.
    \item \textbf{Immediate Access:} Claim and receive the full amount of your tokens instantly during each active claim period, with no locking or vesting required.
    \item \textbf{Future Governance Rights:} Holders of both core assets are expected to be granted additional voting power or unique roles within the future RebelInuX DAO, recognizing their foundational role in the ecosystem.
    \item \textbf{Exclusive Access:} This pack will get first access to future distributions, community events, and partner collaborations, solidifying your status as a core rebel.

\subsection[
  \texorpdfstring{\color{primaryColor}Free Market Dynamics \& Incentives}{Free Market Dynamics \& Incentives}
]{\color{primaryColor}Free Market Dynamics \& Incentives}

The RebelInuX ecosystem is designed around free market principles and powerful incentives rather than artificial restrictions.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{No Artificial Lock-ups:} There is no protocol-level mechanism that prevents a holder from selling their Creator Coin after claiming \$REBL tokens. This ensures immediate liquidity and true ownership for all participants.
    \item \textbf{Value Accrual is the Incentive:} The primary incentive to hold the Creator Coin is the continuous value accrual from the \textbf{cross-chain buy-back mechanism}. As trading activity on ZORA generates ETH revenue used to buy and burn \$REBL, the value of the remaining unclaimed tokens backing each Creator Coin increases.
    \item \textbf{Speculation \& Utility:} The market price of the Creator Coin will reflect both the present value of its remaining claimable \$REBL and the speculative future value of its utilities, such as:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Future governance power in the RebelInuX DAO.
        \item Exclusive access to community events and drops.
        \item Status as a core, foundational member of the rebellion.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

This model creates a transparent and efficient market where the value of the Creator Coin is directly tied to the success and activity of the entire RebelInuX ecosystem.

To ensure long-term alignment and build trust, the entire allocation is subject to a transparent vesting schedule with an initial cliff, locking the majority of tokens for 2 years. \textbf{(See Subsection~\ref{subsec:Ecosystem} for details.)}
  \item \textbf{Community Reserve (13\%) â 1.69B REBL:}
    Strategic reserves locked until March 31, 2026. Upon unlock, full control will be transferred to the RebelInuX DAO for community-governed initiatives.
\textbf{(See Subsection~\ref{subsec:reserve} for details.)}
  \item \textbf{Liquidity Pool (40\%) â 5.2B REBL:}
    Funds liquidity on Raydium. The initial pool will consist of ~3.75B REBL. 90\% of its LP tokens are locked for 1 year; the remainder is reserved for future community-governed initiatives. \textbf{(See Section~\ref{sec:decentralization}.)}
  \item \textbf{Community Distribution (34\%) â 4.42B REBL:}
    Dedicated to rewarding holders of the RebelInuX Creator Coin and Content Coins. Tokens will be distributed according to the claim process outlined in \textbf{Section~\ref{sec:Triple-Asset}}.

The Ecosystem Fund is subject to the following vesting schedule, executed and enforced on-chain to guarantee long-term commitment and transparency:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Platform:} StreamFlow.finance
    \item \textbf{Initial Cliff:} 20\% of allocation (2.6\% of total supply) unlocked at the start (TGE).
    \item \textbf{Linear Vesting:} The remaining 80\% of allocation vests linearly over a 24-month (2-year) period.
    \item \textbf{Current Governance:} The vested tokens are initially released to a secure multi-signature wallet controlled by the founder to prevent single-point-of-failure risks.
    \item \textbf{Future Governance:} The primary goal is to decentralize control. A community proposal will be initiated to transition the fund to a 3-of-5 multi-signature wallet governed by core contributors and established community members as the project grows.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{On-Chain Verification:}

\subsection[
  \texorpdfstring{\color{primaryColor}NFT Holder Reward Mechanism}{NFT Holder Reward Mechanism}
]{\color{primaryColor}NFT Holder Reward Mechanism}

The primary method for community distribution is through the \textbf{RebelInuX triple-asset ecosystem (Creator Coins, Content Coin NFTs, and \$REBL rewards) on ZORA}. The entire Community Distribution Wallet (4.42B \$REBL) on Solana is allocated to reward the holders of \textbf{Creator Coins}.

\subsection*{\color{primaryColor}Fixed Cross-Chain Allocation}

Each \textbf{Creator Coin} is linked to a fixed, predetermined amount of REBL tokens from the community pool on Solana. This creates a powerful cross-chain utility.

The total community distribution pool is 4.42 billion \$REBL. This entire amount will be distributed directly to Creator Coin holders. Therefore, the long-term value of each Creator Coin is pegged to this pool.

\textbf{Each RebelInuX Creator Coin represents a foundational claim of 4.42 \$REBL} on the Solana blockchain, drawn directly from the Community Distribution wallet. This fixed allocation will be distributed over specific claim periods.

Furthermore, the long-term utility of the Creator Coin is designed to evolve. A core proposition of the future RebelInuX DAO will be to discuss and vote on integrating the Community Reserve treasury into this claim mechanism. This would effectively grant each Creator Coin a potential future claim on a portion of the additional 1.69B \$REBL, significantly increasing its underlying value and solidifying its role as the ecosystem's primary value-accruing asset.


\subsection*{\color{primaryColor}Rationale}

This model directly aligns token distribution with proven community engagement (via ownership of the Creator Coin). It incentivizes long-term holding of the core asset and supports a healthy, stable market for \$REBL by distributing tokens through a controlled, claim-based process.

\label{subsec:reserve}
The Community Reserve Wallet (1.69B \$REBL) is a treasury fund dedicated to the long-term health and growth of the RebelInuX ecosystem. \textbf{It is locked in a token lock  contract until March 31, 2026.}

\end{itemize}
% ------------------------------------------------------

Upon unlock, the full allocation will be securely transferred to the \textbf{RebelInuX Treasury Multisig wallet}. This serves as a secure, transitional holding vessel. The multisig's signers will then immediately facilitate the final, community-approved transfer of these funds to the dedicated treasury wallet of the RebelInuX DAO, completing the process of full decentralized community ownership.

\medskip % Adds a small vertical space for better readability

\noindent\textbf{Future Value Accrual to Creator Coins:} A primary goal for the DAO will be to propose and vote on mechanisms to integrate this community-owned treasury with the core triple-asset ecosystem. This could allow the RebelInuX Creator Coin to accrue value beyond its initial 4.42 \$REBL claim, potentially granting holders a right to a portion of the returns generated from this strategic community reserve, further solidifying its role as the ecosystem's foundational asset.

\medskip

Its utilization will be entirely guided by community governance through the DAO. Potential uses, to be decided by community vote, may include:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Strategic Partnerships \& Collaborations:} Forming alliances with other projects, brands, and influencers that align with the RebelInuX ethos to expand reach and utility.
  \item \textbf{Community Grants \& Initiatives:} Funding proposals from community members for development, marketing, content creation, or events that benefit the ecosystem.
  \item \textbf{Exchange Listings:} Covering costs associated with securing listings on major Centralized Exchanges (CEXs) to increase accessibility and liquidity for \$REBL.
  \item \textbf{Ecosystem Incentives:} Bootstrapping and rewarding participation in critical ecosystem functions such as liquidity pools, staking programs, or node operations.
  \item \textbf{Security \& Audits:} Ensuring the ongoing security of the ecosystem by funding smart contract audits and other security measures.
\end{itemize}

This treasury is a strategic asset for the rebellion, ensuring the community will have the resources to adapt, grow, and seize new opportunities in the evolving crypto landscape.

\subsection[
  \texorpdfstring{\color{primaryColor}Cross-Chain Value Acceleration}{Cross-Chain Value Acceleration}
]{\color{primaryColor}Cross-Chain Value Acceleration}

The RebelInuX ecosystem leverages a multi-chain strategy to maximize value for \$REBL holders. Revenue generated from our ZORA assets is strategically used to benefit the Solana-based \$REBL token.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Revenue Generation on ZORA:} All trading fees and rewards from the RebelInuX \textbf{Creator Coin} and \textbf{Content Coin NFTs} generate a continuous stream of income denominated in ETH.
  \item \textbf{Strategic Allocation of Revenue:} All accumulated ETH revenue is strategically split: \textbf{80\% is bridged to Solana to buy back \$REBL tokens} from the open market (e.g., on Raydium), \textbf{15\% is sent to the Community Reserve wallet}, and \textbf{5\% is retained for ongoing operational costs} on ZORA. 
    \item \textbf{Community Reserve ETH Strategy:} The ETH allocated to the Community Reserve will be strategically deployed to further accelerate ecosystem growth. Its primary use will be to fund additional community-governed buy-back and burn campaigns, creating a powerful, multi-layered deflationary mechanism for the \$REBL token.
    \item \textbf{Value Distribution to \$REBL Holders:} The \$REBL tokens purchased from buy-backs are permanently burned, increasing the scarcity and value of all remaining tokens.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Rationale:} This creates a powerful cross-chain feedback loop. Success and trading activity of our ZORA-based assets directly translates into buying pressure and value accumulation for the \$REBL token on Solana.

The primary utilities of \$REBL are governance of the DAO and value accrual via the burn mechanism. The community may propose and vote on additional utilities, such as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Staking rewards to incentivize long-term holding.
    \item Using \$REBL as a preferred currency for fees within ecosystem products.
    \item Granting bonus yields or exclusive access to holders of the core RebelInuX NFTs.

]{\color{primaryColor}\textbf{Ecosystem Security \& Infrastructure}}

Our commitment to security extends beyond our own contracts to the foundational layers we build upon. We have chosen industry-leading platforms for their proven security, decentralization, and reliability.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{ZORA Network Security:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Our Creator Coins and Content Coin NFTs are deployed on the ZORA network, an Ethereum Layer-2 built on the \textbf{Base} blockchain.
        \item ZORA inherits the robust security of the Ethereum ecosystem while offering low-cost and efficient transactions.
        \item The platform has undergone extensive security audits and is designed to be secure by default, minimizing the risk for creators and collectors.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Base Blockchain Security:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Base is a \textbf{secured, Ethereum Layer-2} chain incubated by Coinbase. It is built on the MIT-licensed OP Stack, the same technology powering Optimism.
        \item It benefits from the full security of Ethereum's base layer while being significantly faster and cheaper.
        \item As a leading L2, Base is maintained by a large, skilled team of engineers and researchers dedicated to its security and performance, providing a reliable foundation for our assets.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Solana Blockchain Performance:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The \$REBL token resides on the Solana blockchain, chosen for its \textbf{high throughput, low transaction costs, and speed}.
        \item Solana's unique Proof-of-History (PoH) consensus provides deterministic leadership scheduling, making it highly resistant to censorship and capable of supporting a global-scale community.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\noindent
This multi-chain architecture strategically leverages the core strength of each platform: ZORA/Base for secure digital ownership and Solana for high-performance tokenomics.

\subsection[
  \texorpdfstring{\color{primaryColor}Current State of Decentralization}{Current State of Decentralization}
]{\color{primaryColor}\textbf{Current State of Decentralization}}
\label{sec:decentralization}
At RebelInuX, our foundational principles are transparency, decentralization, and security. We believe that true empowerment arises when control is distributed across the community, eliminating central points of authority and fostering an open, trustless environment.

\noindent
\textbf{\$REBL Token on Solana:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Contract Renouncement:} The \textbf{Freeze Authority, Mint Authority, and Update Authority} for the \$REBL token smart contract have been permanently renounced. This action is verifiable on-chain and is a fundamental commitment to decentralization.
    \item \textbf{Implications of Renouncement:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{No Rug Pulls:} No single entity can freeze token transfers or mint new \$REBL tokens, ensuring a fair distribution.
        \item \textbf{Immutable Code:} The smart contract code is now immutable. All future changes must be proposed and approved by the community through our forthcoming governance system.
        \item \textbf{Community Control:} The future of the protocol is entirely in the hands of \$REBL token holders.
    \end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Liquidity Protection:} The initial REBL/SOL pool on Raydium will have \textbf{90\% of its LP tokens locked for one year} at launch. The remaining 10\% is reserved for future community-approved pairs, ensuring a stable trading environment. \textbf{The LP lock will be performed using UNCX Network, and the verified transaction will be announced to the community upon completion.}
    \item \textbf{Team Alignment:} Tokens allocated to the ecosystem fund are subject to a transparent, linear vesting schedule over two years, ensuring our long-term interests are fully aligned with those of the community.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\textbf{Creator Coins \& Content Coin NFTs on ZORA:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Founder Commitment:} 50\% of the Creator Coins supply is allocated to the founder and subject to a 5-year linear vesting schedule, ensuring long-term alignment.
    \item \textbf{Decentralized Ownership:} Each asset is owned directly by the holder, secured by the ZORA protocol on Base.
    \item \textbf{Immutable Contracts:} Smart contracts are non-upgradeable; behavior and metadata cannot be changed after deployment.
    \item \textbf{Transparent Provenance:} All asset history is immutably recorded on-chain, providing verifiable authenticity.
    \item \textbf{Censorship-Resistant:} Assets cannot be altered, frozen, or seized by any central party, guaranteeing true ownership.
    \item \textbf{Community-Rewards Mechanism:} Distributes claim rights to \$REBL tokens directly to asset holders without intermediary control.
\end{itemize}

Our vision is to cultivate an unstoppable rebellionâresistant to censorship, manipulation, and centralized control. These actions form the immutable foundation of a community-led movement that stands resilient and autonomous.

\subsection*{Volatility \& Market Manipulation}
Participants in the RebelInuX ecosystem should be aware of the highly volatile and speculative nature of cryptoasset markets. Upon the launch of our initial liquidity pool, which will start with a controlled depth, it is common for automated bots and large-scale traders ("whales") to engage in market manipulation strategies. This can include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Extreme Price Volatility:} Rapid and significant price increases ("pumps") and decreases ("dumps").
    \item \textbf{"Sniping" and Front-running:} Bots may execute transactions before others, gaining an unfair advantage.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\textbf{This activity is an external feature of the trading environment and is not initiated by, nor within the control of, the RebelInuX team.} Our foundational mitigations against malicious activity are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The permanent renouncement of mint, freeze, and update authorities.
    \item The locking of \textbf{90\% of the initial liquidity pool (LP) tokens}. The remaining portion is held in a secure multisig wallet for future community-approved initiatives, such as additional trading pairs.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
Investors should exercise extreme caution, conduct their own research (DYOR), and never invest more than they are willing to lose. The RebelInuX project is focused on long-term utility and growth, not short-term price action.
